# donutshop-microservices
This repo doesn't have anything to do with donuts. This is purely meant for implementing a microservices architecture and will be very similar to eShopOnContainers by Microsoft

## Goals of this repo

### Today
 - Create two self-contained services (.Net Core for now) with their own datastores
 - Have an event bus to communicate between the two services
 - Have an API Gateway or a BFF between the client and the 2 services

### Next
 - Authentication and Authorisation
 - Setup logging and monitoring
